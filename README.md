## Introduction

The Tic Tac Toe project is a web application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for a player to get three of their marks (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components and functionalities:

### App Component:

- This is the main component of the application.
- It manages the game's state, including the current state of the board and which player's turn it is.
- The `useState` hook from React is used to manage the state in a functional component.
- It also contains a helper function, `calculateWinner`, to determine if a player has won the game based on the current board state.

### Board Component:

- The `Board` component renders the 3x3 grid of squares.
- It receives the `squares` array and `onClick` function as props from the App component.
- The `squares` array contains the current state of the board (X, O, or null if the square is empty).
- It maps over the `squares` array and renders the individual Square components.
- The `onClick` function is passed down to each Square component to handle clicks on the squares.

### Square Component:

- The `Square` component represents a single square on the board.
- It receives the `value` and `onClick` function as props from the Board component.
- The `value` prop represents the current mark in the square (X, O, or null).
- When a square is clicked, the `onClick` function is called, which triggers the `handleSquareClick` function in the App component.

### CSS Styling:

- The application includes simple CSS styling to make the board and squares visually appealing.
- The board is displayed as a 3x3 grid using CSS grid properties.
- The squares are styled as buttons with borders and a background color to resemble the classic Tic Tac Toe grid.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Use Create React App to set up a new React project with the Tic Tac Toe code.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your default web browser.

## Conclusion

The Tic Tac Toe project demonstrates how to build a simple interactive web application using React's component-based architecture and state management. It provides a great example of how React can be utilized to create interactive user interfaces for various applications.
